### Setup

1. Clone the Repository
2. Go to Cloned Repository folder and install dependencies with `npm i`
3. Go into frontend and start up frontend with `npm start`.
4. Go to localhost:3000 Grab a friend and play offline mode (WASD keys for Player 1 and 8456 keys for Player 2)

Online multiplayer browser mode is still a WIP. Will use MONGO DB, and websockets to set up browser based multiplayer system.
